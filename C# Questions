1)What Is C#.
->C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
->C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.

2)What is C# Data Types (Value & References type).
->Value Types->Value types store the actual data directly in memory.
When you assign a value type variable to another variable, a copy of the value is created.
-Stored on the stack (mostly)
-Each variable has its own copy of data
-Changes in one variable do not affect another
Examples:
int
float
double
decimal
bool
char
struct
enum

->Reference Types->Reference types store a reference (memory address) to the actual data, not the data itself.
When you assign a reference type variable to another variable, both point to the same object in memory.
-Stored on the heap
-Variables share the same memory reference
Examples:
class
string
array
object
interface
delegate


3)What is C# Literals?
->In C#, a literal is a fixed value written directly in the source code.
Literals represent constant values that do not change during program execution.
Types of C# Literals
Integer Literals
Floating-Point Literals
Character Literals
String Literals
Boolean Literals
Null Literal

4)What is Type Casting?
->Type Casting is the process of explicitly converting one data type into another using a cast operator.
  It is mainly used when data loss may occur.

Type Conversion?
-Implicit Conversion (Automatic)->int a = 10;
double b = a;   // Implicit conversion
-Explicit Conversion (Manual)->char ch = 'A';
int ascii = ch;   // Implicit conversion
