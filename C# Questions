1)What Is C#.
->C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
->C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.

2)What is C# Data Types (Value & References type).
->Value Types->Value types store the actual data directly in memory.
When you assign a value type variable to another variable, a copy of the value is created.
-Stored on the stack (mostly)
-Each variable has its own copy of data
-Changes in one variable do not affect another
Examples:
int
float
double
decimal
bool
char
struct
enum

->Reference Types->Reference types store a reference (memory address) to the actual data, not the data itself.
When you assign a reference type variable to another variable, both point to the same object in memory.
-Stored on the heap
-Variables share the same memory reference
Examples:
class
string
array
object
interface
delegate


3)What is C# Literals?
->In C#, a literal is a fixed value written directly in the source code.
Literals represent constant values that do not change during program execution.
Types of C# Literals
Integer Literals
Floating-Point Literals
Character Literals
String Literals
Boolean Literals
Null Literal

4)What is Type Casting?
->Type Casting is the process of explicitly converting one data type into another using a cast operator.
  It is mainly used when data loss may occur.

Type Conversion?
-Implicit Conversion (Automatic)->int a = 10;
double b = a;   // Implicit conversion
-Explicit Conversion (Manual)->double x = 25.75;
int y = (int)x;   // Explicit conversion


4)What is C# Variable & Constant
->A variable in C# is a named memory location used to store data that can change during program execution.
Syntax->dataType variableName = value;
->A constant in C# is a fixed value whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned.
->Value cannot be modified
  Declared using the const keyword
  Must be assigned at declaration time
Syntax->const dataType constantName = value;

5)what is C# Operators?
->1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators->Used to perform mathematical calculations.
   | Operator | Meaning             | Example |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| `+`      | Addition            | `a + b` |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `a - b` |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `a * b` |
| `/`      | Division            | `a / b` |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `a % b` |

2️⃣ Logical Operators->Used to combine conditions and return true or false.
| Operator | Meaning     |   
| -------- | ----------- | 
| `&&`     | Logical AND |         
| `||'     | Logical OR  |
| `!`      | Logical NOT |   

3️⃣ Bitwise Operators->Used to perform operations at the binary (bit) level.
| Operator | Meaning     |            
| -------- | ----------- | 
| `&`      | Bitwise AND |            
| `||`     |  Bitwise OR |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR |            
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT |            
| `<<`     | Left Shift  |            
| `>>`     | Right Shift |            

4️⃣ Ternary Operator->Used as a short form of if-else.
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;

6)C# Control Flow Statements
-Control flow statements in C# are used to control the order in which program statements are executed based on conditions or repetition.
1️⃣ if Statement->Executes code only when a condition is true.
2️⃣ if–else Statement->Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise executes the else block.
3️⃣ else–if Ladder->Used to check multiple conditions.
4️⃣ switch Statement->Used to select one option from many choices based on a value.
5️⃣ Loops->Loops are used to repeat code multiple times.
   🔹 for Loop->Used when the number of iterations is known.
   🔹 while Loop->Executes while the condition is true.
   🔹 do–while Loop->Executes at least once, then checks the condition.
   🔹 foreach Loop->Used to iterate over collections like arrays or lists.
