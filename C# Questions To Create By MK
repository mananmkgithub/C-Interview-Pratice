 ----------------------------------------- C# Basics -----------------------------------------
1)What Is C#.
->C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
->C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.

2)What is C# Data Types (Value & References type).
->Value Types->Value types store the actual data directly in memory.
When you assign a value type variable to another variable, a copy of the value is created.
-Stored on the stack (mostly)
-Each variable has its own copy of data
-Changes in one variable do not affect another                  
Examples:
int
float
double
decimal
bool
char
struct
enum

->Reference Types->Reference types store a reference (memory address) to the actual data, not the data itself.
When you assign a reference type variable to another variable, both point to the same object in memory.
-Stored on the heap`
-Variables share the same memory reference
Examples:
class
string
array
object
interface
delegate


3)What is C# Literals?
->In C#, a literal is a fixed value written directly in the source code.
Literals represent constant values that do not change during program execution.
Types of C# Literals
Integer Literals
Floating-Point Literals
Character Literals
String Literals
Boolean Literals
Null Literal

4)What is Type Casting?
->Type Casting is the process of explicitly converting one data type into another using a cast operator.
  It is mainly used when data loss may occur.

Type Conversion?
-Implicit Conversion (Automatic)->int a = 10;
double b = a;   // Implicit conversion
-Explicit Conversion (Manual)->double x = 25.75;
int y = (int)x;   // Explicit conversion


4)What is C# Variable & Constant
->A variable in C# is a named memory location used to store data that can change during program execution.
Syntax->dataType variableName = value;
->A constant in C# is a fixed value whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned.
->Value cannot be modified
  Declared using the const keyword
  Must be assigned at declaration time
Syntax->const dataType constantName = value;

5)what is C# Operators?
->1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators->Used to perform mathematical calculations.
   | Operator | Meaning             | Example |

| `-`      | Subtraction         | `a - b` |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `a * b` |
| `/`      | Division            | `a / b` |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `a % b` |

2️⃣ Logical Operators->Used to combine conditions and return true or false.
| Operator | Meaning     |   
| -------- | ----------- | 
| `&&`     | Logical AND |         
| `||'     | Logical OR  |
| `!`      | Logical NOT |   

3️⃣ Bitwise Operators->Used to perform operations at the binary (bit) level.
| Operator | Meaning     |            
| -------- | ----------- | 
| `&`      | Bitwise AND |            
| `||`     |  Bitwise OR |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR |            
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT |            
| `<<`     | Left Shift  |            
| `>>`     | Right Shift |            

4️⃣ Ternary Operator->Used as a short form of if-else.
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;

6)C# Control Flow Statements
-Control flow statements in C# are used to control the order in which program statements are executed based on conditions or repetition.
1️⃣ if Statement->Executes code only when a condition is true.
2️⃣ if–else Statement->Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise executes the else block.
3️⃣ else–if Ladder->Used to check multiple conditions.
4️⃣ switch Statement->Used to select one option from many choices based on a value.
5️⃣ Loops->Loops are used to repeat code multiple times.
   🔹 for Loop->Used when the number of iterations is known.
   🔹 while Loop->Executes while the condition is true.
   🔹 do–while Loop->Executes at least once, then checks the condition.
   🔹 foreach Loop->Used to iterate over collections like arrays or lists.

----------------------------------------------Function & Methods---------------------------------------------------
1)What is Method Declaration & Invocation?
--Method Declaration 
-A method declaration defines a method by specifying its name, return type, parameters, and body.
It tells the compiler what the method will do.
--Method Invocation
-A method invocation means calling or executing a method to perform its defined task.

2)What is Method Overloading?
-Method Overloading in C# means having multiple methods with the same name in the same class but with different parameters is called to Method Overloading.
-The compiler decides which method to call based on the number, type, or order of parameters.

3)What is User-Defined Function?
-A user-defined function is a function created by the programmer to perform a specific task.
It helps in reusing code, improving readability, and reducing repetition.
-Types of User-Defined Functions
  No parameter, no return value
  With parameter, no return value
  No parameter, with return value
  With parameter, with return value

4)What Call by Value & Call by Reference (ref, out, in)?
-Call by Value → Copy of value
ref → Reference (read & write)
out → Output value
in → Read-only reference

5)What is Recursion?
->Recursion is a programming technique in which a method calls itself to solve a problem.
It continues until a base condition is met to stop the recursive calls.

6)What is Named & Optional Parameters?
->Named parameters allow you to pass arguments to a method by specifying the parameter name, so the order of parameters does not matter.
->Optional parameters are parameters that have default values.
If no value is passed during method call, the default value is used automatically.

7)What is Params Array?
->A params array in C# allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments as a single parameter.
It is declared using the params keyword.
-Params Array Means Variable number of arguments.
-Purpose Flexibility & cleaner code.


---------------------------------------------User Interaction --------------------------------------------------------
1)What is User Input (Console.ReadLine)?
->User input in C# means taking data from the user at runtime.
Console.ReadLine() is used to read a line of text entered by the user from the console.

2)What is Output (Console.WriteLine)?
->Console.WriteLine() is used to print text or values on the console and then move the cursor to the next line.

3)What is Command Line Argument?
->A command line argument is a value passed to a program when it starts running from the command prompt or terminal.
In C#, command line arguments are received using the Main(string[] args) parameter.

4)What is String Formatting & String Interpolation?
->String formatting is a way to insert values into a string using placeholders like {0}, {1}, etc.
->String interpolation is a modern and cleaner way to embed variables directly inside a string using $"".


-------------------------------------------Language Essentials--------------------------------------------------------
1)What is C# Keywords?
->C# keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the C# language.
They are predefined by the compiler and cannot be used as variable, method, or class names.

2)What is Nullable Types in C#?
->Nullable types in C# allow value types (like int, bool, DateTime) to store null values.
They are useful when a variable may not have a value.

Short Syntax (?)
int? age = null;
bool? isActive = true;

Long Syntax
Nullable<int> marks = null;


3)What is String Operations in C#?
->String operations in C# are methods and techniques used to manipulate strings, such as creating, modifying, comparing, searching, and formatting text data.
  string first = "Hello";
  string second = "World";
  string result = first + " " + second;

  string name = "Rahul";
  Console.WriteLine(name.Length);   // 5

  string text = "CSharp";
  string part = text.Substring(1, 3);  // Sha

  string msg = "Hello World";
  string newMsg = msg.Replace("World", "C#");

  string name = "Manan";
  Console.WriteLine(name.ToUpper());
  Console.WriteLine(name.ToLower());

  string data = "  Hello  ";
  Console.WriteLine(data.Trim());

  string email = "test@gmail.com";

  email.Contains("@");
  email.StartsWith("test");
  email.EndsWith(".com");

  string line = "A,B,C";
  string[] values = line.Split(',');

  string a = "Hello";
  string b = "hello";
  bool equal = a.Equals(b, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

  string name = "Rahul";
  int age = 25
  Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}");


4)What is StringBuilder?
->StringBuilder is a class in C# used to create and modify strings efficiently without creating new string objects every time.
It is useful when string data changes frequently.

using System.Text;
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.Append("Hello");
sb.Append(" ");
sb.Append("World");
Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
->Common StringBuilder Methods
Append()
AppendLine()
Insert()
Remove()
Replace()
Clear()

5)Constant (const) vs ReadOnly (readonly) in C#?
->const (Constant)
  A constant is a variable whose value is fixed at compile time and cannot be changed ever.
->readonly
  A readonly variable is a field whose value can be assigned only once, either at declaration time or inside a constructor, and cannot be modified afterward.

6)What is C# Properties: Auto, Backed & Expression-Bodied?
->Property (General)
  A property in C# is a member that provides controlled access to a class field using get and set accessors.
->Auto-Implemented Property
  An auto property is a property where the compiler automatically creates the backing field.
  It is used when no extra logic is needed in get/set.

->Backed Property
  A backed property (backing-field property) uses a private field to store the value and allows custom logic in get/set.

->Expression-Bodied Property
  An expression-bodied property is a short, concise syntax for properties that return a single expression.

1️⃣ Auto-Implemented Property
   Example
   class Student
   {
    public int Age { get; set; }
    }
2️⃣ Backed Property (Private Field)
    Example
    class Student
    {
    private int _age;
    public int Age
    {
        get { return _age; }
        set
        {
            if (value > 0)
                _age = value;
        }
     }
    }
3️⃣ Expression-Bodied Property
class Student
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }

    public string FullName => $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
}

7)Stack vs Heap Memory (C#)?
| Feature      |  Stack Memory| Heap Memory            |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Storage      | Value types  | Reference types        |
| Allocation   | Automatic    | Dynamic                |
| Deallocation | Automatic    | Garbage Collector      |
| Speed        | Fast         | Slower                 |
| Size         | Limited      | Large                  |
| Lifetime     | Method scope | Application controlled |
| Access       | Direct       | Reference-based        |


8)Boxing & Unboxing in C#?
->Boxing is the process of converting a value type into a reference type (object).
The value is wrapped inside an object and stored on the heap.

-Unboxing is the process of extracting the value type from the object back into its original value type.

9)Exception Handling in C# (try, catch, finally, throw)?
->Exception handling in C# is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors gracefully so that the program does not crash and continues execution in a controlled manner.
1️⃣ try Block-> The try block contains code that may cause an exception during program execution.
2️⃣ catch Block->The catch block handles the exception thrown in the try block and allows the program to continue execution.
3️⃣ finally Block->The finally block contains code that is always executed, whether an exception occurs or not.
4️⃣ throw Keyword->The throw keyword is used to explicitly generate an exception in a program.

10)Enum & Struct in C#?
->An enum is a value type that is used to define a set of named constant values, which makes the code more readable and meaningful.
Struct->A struct is a value type in C# used to group related variables of different data types into a single unit.

Enum (Enumeration)
enum Day
{
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday
}
how to use
Day today = Day.Monday;
Struct
struct Employee
{
    public int Id;
    public string Name;
}
how to use
Employee emp;
emp.Id = 1;
emp.Name = "Rahul";

One-Line Summary
Enum → Fixed named constants
Struct → Small grouped data


-----------------------------------------------Object-Oriented Programming(oop)------------------------------------------------
1)What Is The Oops and difference Between Functional & Object Oritend Programming Langauge?
->OOPs is a programming style where a program is built using objects that contain data and functions.
->Object-oriented programming is a programming style where programs are created using classes and objects.
OOPs 4 Pillars
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Functional programming is a programming style where programs are written using functions and data does not change.
| Feature             | Functional Programming | Object-Oriented Programming |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Focus               | Functions              | Objects                     |
| Data                | Immutable              | Mutable                     |
| State               | Avoids state           | Uses state                  |
| Code style          | Declarative            | Imperative                  |
| Reusability         | Function reuse         | Class & inheritance         |
| Real-world modeling | Difficult              | Easy                        |
| Examples            | F#, Haskell            | C#, Java                    |

2)What Is Class & Objects?
->class->A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (data/fields) and methods (behavior/functions) for objects.
  It does not occupy memory until an object is created.
  Think of it as a design or plan for an entity.

->object->An object is a real-world instance of a class.
  It contains actual data in memory.
  Objects have state (properties) and behavior (methods) as defined in their class.

3)What Is Constructor & Destructors?
->A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is created.
->It is used to initialize objects and set default values.
->Constructor name must be the same as the class name.
->No return type, not even void.
Types Of Constructor
Default Constructor->Called automatically when no constructor is defined.
Parameterized Constructor->Allows passing values during object creation.
Static Constructor->Used to initialize static members of the class. Called once automatically when the class is loaded.
                    Cannot take parameters.
Copy Constructor->A Copy Constructor is a constructor that creates a new object by copying the data of an existing object of the same class.
C# does not provide a built-in copy constructor, but you can create your own.'

this Keyword in C#->The this keyword in C# refers to the current instance of the class.

Destuctors
A destructor is a special method in C# that is used to release resources and clean up memory when an object is destroyed.

4)What is Encapsulation?
->Encapsulation is the process of hiding data inside a class and only allowing it to be accessed through public methods or properties.
It is also known as data hiding.
Purpose / Why we use Encapsulation
To protect data from unauthorized access.
To make the code secure and maintainable.
To control how data is accessed or modified.
To implement data hiding using access modifiers (private, public, etc.).

5)What is Inheritance?
->inheritance is an OOP concept in which one class (child/derived) can reuse and extend the properties and methods of another class (parent/base).
It promotes:
Code reusability
Extensibility
Polymorphism

->Types Of Inheritance
Single Inheritance->One derived class inherits from one base class is called single Inheritance.
Multilevel Inheritance->A class inherits from another derived class (like a chain) is called Multilevel Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance->Multiple classes inherit from the same base class is called Hierarchical Inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance (via Interface)
In C#, a class cannot inherit from more than one class directly (to avoid ambiguity).
But it can implement multiple interfaces.
Hybrid Inheritance (via Interface)->combination of more than one type of inheritance (like hierarchical + multiple).
In C#, hybrid inheritance is possible only using interfaces, not classes.


6)What is Ploymorphism(Compile-time & RunTime)?
->Polymorphism means “many forms” — it allows a single function, method, or object to behave differently in different situations.
It helps you reuse the same method name with different implementations
In simple words:
One name — many behaviors.
Types of Polymorphism in C#
1)Compile-time Polymorphism(Static Polymorphism)
2)Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

Static Polymorphism (Compile-time Polymorphism)
->When a method performs different tasks based on parameters (number or type), it is called Static Polymorphism or Method Overloading.
It is resolved during compile time.
Same method name, different parameters.

->Runtime Polymorphism (also called Dynamic Polymorphism) occurs when a method in a base class is overridden in a derived class, and the method call is determined at runtime based on the object type.
In simple words:
The same method name behaves differently depending on the object that calls it.
Runtime polymorphism is achieved through:
Method Overriding
Using the virtual and override keywords
virtual keyword → Allows the base class method to be overridden.
override keyword → Defines a new implementation in the derived class.
Base class reference (Animal a) points to derived class objects (Dog, Cat).
At runtime, CLR (Common Language Runtime) decides which Speak() to call.

7)What is Abstract Classes & Methods?
->data abstraction
“Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only what is necessary.”
In C#, it is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.”
Purpose of Abstraction
✅ To reduce complexity of code
✅ To improve security by hiding details
✅ To focus on what an object does, not how it does it
✅ Makes programs easier to understand and maintain

interface
An interface is a blueprint or contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement.
It helps achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in C#.
| Feature              | Abstract Class                             | Interface                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Contains**         | Abstract + Concrete methods                | Only abstract members                     |
| **Access Modifiers** | Can use `public`, `private`, etc.          | All members are public                    |
| **Inheritance**      | Supports single inheritance                | Supports multiple inheritance             |
| **Usage**            | Used for shared base with default behavior | Used for defining common behavior (rules) |


8)What is Sealed Classes?
->A sealed class in C# is a class that cannot be inherited by any other class is called to Sealed Class.
  Used for
Security, performance, fixed behavior.

9)What is Static Classes and Members?
->A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains only static members.
->A static member (variable, method, property) belongs to the class itself, not to any object.

10)What is Partital Classes?
->A partial class allows a single class to be split into multiple files, but all parts are combined into one class at compile time.

11)What is Object Initializers?
->An object initializer allows you to create and initialize an object in a single statement without calling a constructor explicitly.

12)What is Access Modifier?
->>Access modifiers in C# are keywords that define the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, and members.
They control which parts of a program can access a class or member.
Help in data encapsulation and security.
public->Member is accessible from anywhere 
        Everywhere in the project or assembly.
private->Member is accessible only within the class.
         Inside the class only
protected->Member is accessible within the class and derived classes.
           Class + inheritance.
internal->Member is accessible only within the same assembly.
         Same project/assembly.
protected internal->Member is accessible within the same assembly or derived class.
                  ->Combination of protected & internal.

13)what is Delegates & Events?
->Delegates->Type of Delegate:-
1) Single Cast Delegate:-We can call one delegate to one function
2) Multicast Delegate:- We can \point one delegate to multiple functions address

->Events->An event is a mechanism that allows a class to notify other classes when something happens, using delegates.

14)What is Lambda Expressions?
->A lambda expression is a short, anonymous function that is used to write inline logic without creating a separate method.
Example Without Lambda
int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
Same Example Using Lambda
Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;
Console.WriteLine(add(2, 3));

15)What is Anonymous Methods?
->An anonymous method is a method without a name that is defined inline and assigned to a delegate.
🔹 Example Without Anonymous Method
delegate void MyDelegate(int x);

static void Show(int x)
{
    Console.WriteLine(x);
}
MyDelegate d = Show;

🔹 Same Example Using Anonymous Method
delegate void MyDelegate(int x);
MyDelegate d = delegate (int x)
{
    Console.WriteLine(x);
};
d(10);

16)what is Func,Action,Predicate?
->Func
Func is a generic delegate that takes parameters and returns a value.
->Action
Action is a generic delegate that takes parameters but does NOT return any value.
->Predicate
Predicate is a generic delegate that takes one parameter and always returns a boolean (true/false).

--------------------------------------------------------Collections & Generics --------------------------------------------------------------
1)What is The Array(1D,2D,Jagged)
->An array is a collection of same-type elements stored in continuous memory locations and accessed using an index.
1D Array->A 1D array is an array that stores elements in a single linear sequence and is accessed using one index.
2D Array->A 2D array is an array that stores data in rows and columns and is accessed using two indexes.
Jagged Array->A jagged array is an array of arrays where each inner array can have a different size.
| Feature   | 1D Array   | 2D Array           | Jagged Array         |

4)IEnumerable Vs IEnumerator
->IEnumerable
  IEnumerable is an interface that provides a collection for iteration and returns an IEnumerator.

->IEnumerator
 IEnumerator is an interface that controls the iteration process over a collection.

IEnumerable<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
IEnumerator<int> enumerator = numbers.GetEnumerator();
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
    Console.WriteLine(enumerator.Current);
}

5)Yield return?
->yield return is used to return elements one at a time from a method, without creating a full collection, while maintaining the method’s state.
| return                 | yield return           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Returns once           | Returns multiple times |
