 ----------------------------------------- C# Basics -----------------------------------------
1)What Is C#.
->C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
->C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.

2)What is C# Data Types (Value & References type).
->Value Types->Value types store the actual data directly in memory.
When you assign a value type variable to another variable, a copy of the value is created.
-Stored on the stack (mostly)
-Each variable has its own copy of data
-Changes in one variable do not affect another                  
Examples:
int
float
double
decimal
bool
char
struct
enum

->Reference Types->Reference types store a reference (memory address) to the actual data, not the data itself.
When you assign a reference type variable to another variable, both point to the same object in memory.
-Stored on the heap`
-Variables share the same memory reference
Examples:
class
string
array
object
interface
delegate


3)What is C# Literals?
->In C#, a literal is a fixed value written directly in the source code.
Literals represent constant values that do not change during program execution.
Types of C# Literals
Integer Literals
Floating-Point Literals
Character Literals
String Literals
Boolean Literals
Null Literal

4)What is Type Casting?
->Type Casting is the process of explicitly converting one data type into another using a cast operator.
  It is mainly used when data loss may occur.

Type Conversion?
-Implicit Conversion (Automatic)->int a = 10;
double b = a;   // Implicit conversion
-Explicit Conversion (Manual)->double x = 25.75;
int y = (int)x;   // Explicit conversion


4)What is C# Variable & Constant
->A variable in C# is a named memory location used to store data that can change during program execution.
Syntax->dataType variableName = value;
->A constant in C# is a fixed value whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned.
->Value cannot be modified
  Declared using the const keyword
  Must be assigned at declaration time
Syntax->const dataType constantName = value;

5)what is C# Operators?
->1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators->Used to perform mathematical calculations.
   | Operator | Meaning             | Example |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| `+`      | Addition            | `a + b` |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `a - b` |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `a * b` |
| `/`      | Division            | `a / b` |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `a % b` |

2️⃣ Logical Operators->Used to combine conditions and return true or false.
| Operator | Meaning     |   
| -------- | ----------- | 
| `&&`     | Logical AND |         
| `||'     | Logical OR  |
| `!`      | Logical NOT |   

3️⃣ Bitwise Operators->Used to perform operations at the binary (bit) level.
| Operator | Meaning     |            
| -------- | ----------- | 
| `&`      | Bitwise AND |            
| `||`     |  Bitwise OR |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR |            
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT |            
| `<<`     | Left Shift  |            
| `>>`     | Right Shift |            

4️⃣ Ternary Operator->Used as a short form of if-else.
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;

6)C# Control Flow Statements
-Control flow statements in C# are used to control the order in which program statements are executed based on conditions or repetition.
1️⃣ if Statement->Executes code only when a condition is true.
2️⃣ if–else Statement->Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise executes the else block.
3️⃣ else–if Ladder->Used to check multiple conditions.
4️⃣ switch Statement->Used to select one option from many choices based on a value.
5️⃣ Loops->Loops are used to repeat code multiple times.
   🔹 for Loop->Used when the number of iterations is known.
   🔹 while Loop->Executes while the condition is true.
   🔹 do–while Loop->Executes at least once, then checks the condition.
   🔹 foreach Loop->Used to iterate over collections like arrays or lists.

----------------------------------------------Function & Methods---------------------------------------------------
1)What is Method Declaration & Invocation?
--Method Declaration 
-A method declaration defines a method by specifying its name, return type, parameters, and body.
It tells the compiler what the method will do.
--Method Invocation
-A method invocation means calling or executing a method to perform its defined task.

2)What is Method Overloading?
-Method Overloading in C# means having multiple methods with the same name in the same class but with different parameters is called to Method Overloading.
-The compiler decides which method to call based on the number, type, or order of parameters.

3)What is User-Defined Function?
-A user-defined function is a function created by the programmer to perform a specific task.
It helps in reusing code, improving readability, and reducing repetition.
-Types of User-Defined Functions
  No parameter, no return value
  With parameter, no return value
  No parameter, with return value
  With parameter, with return value

4)What Call by Value & Call by Reference (ref, out, in)?
-Call by Value → Copy of value
ref → Reference (read & write)
out → Output value
in → Read-only reference

5)What is Recursion?
->Recursion is a programming technique in which a method calls itself to solve a problem.
It continues until a base condition is met to stop the recursive calls.

6)What is Named & Optional Parameters?
->Named parameters allow you to pass arguments to a method by specifying the parameter name, so the order of parameters does not matter.
->Optional parameters are parameters that have default values.
If no value is passed during method call, the default value is used automatically.

7)What is Params Array?
->A params array in C# allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments as a single parameter.
It is declared using the params keyword.
-Params Array Means Variable number of arguments.
-Purpose Flexibility & cleaner code.


---------------------------------------------User Interaction --------------------------------------------------------
1)What is User Input (Console.ReadLine)?
->User input in C# means taking data from the user at runtime.
Console.ReadLine() is used to read a line of text entered by the user from the console.

2)What is Output (Console.WriteLine)?
->Console.WriteLine() is used to print text or values on the console and then move the cursor to the next line.

3)What is Command Line Argument?
->A command line argument is a value passed to a program when it starts running from the command prompt or terminal.
In C#, command line arguments are received using the Main(string[] args) parameter.

4)What is String Formatting & String Interpolation?
->String formatting is a way to insert values into a string using placeholders like {0}, {1}, etc.
->String interpolation is a modern and cleaner way to embed variables directly inside a string using $"".


-------------------------------------------Language Essentials--------------------------------------------------------
1)What is C# Keywords?
->C# keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the C# language.
They are predefined by the compiler and cannot be used as variable, method, or class names.

2)What is Nullable Types in C#?
->Nullable types in C# allow value types (like int, bool, DateTime) to store null values.
They are useful when a variable may not have a value.

Short Syntax (?)
int? age = null;
bool? isActive = true;

Long Syntax
Nullable<int> marks = null;


3)What is String Operations in C#?
->String operations in C# are methods and techniques used to manipulate strings, such as creating, modifying, comparing, searching, and formatting text data.
  string first = "Hello";
  string second = "World";
  string result = first + " " + second;

  string name = "Rahul";
  Console.WriteLine(name.Length);   // 5

  string text = "CSharp";
  string part = text.Substring(1, 3);  // Sha

  string msg = "Hello World";
  string newMsg = msg.Replace("World", "C#");

  string name = "Manan";
  Console.WriteLine(name.ToUpper());
  Console.WriteLine(name.ToLower());

  string data = "  Hello  ";
  Console.WriteLine(data.Trim());

  string email = "test@gmail.com";

  email.Contains("@");
  email.StartsWith("test");
  email.EndsWith(".com");

  string line = "A,B,C";
  string[] values = line.Split(',');

  string a = "Hello";
  string b = "hello";
  bool equal = a.Equals(b, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

  string name = "Rahul";
  int age = 25
  Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}");


4)What is StringBuilder?
->StringBuilder is a class in C# used to create and modify strings efficiently without creating new string objects every time.
It is useful when string data changes frequently.

using System.Text;
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.Append("Hello");
sb.Append(" ");
sb.Append("World");
Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
->Common StringBuilder Methods
Append()
AppendLine()
Insert()
Remove()
Replace()
Clear()

5)Constant (const) vs ReadOnly (readonly) in C#?
->const (Constant)
  A constant is a variable whose value is fixed at compile time and cannot be changed ever.
->readonly
  A readonly variable is a field whose value can be assigned only once, either at declaration time or inside a constructor, and cannot be modified afterward.

6)What is C# Properties: Auto, Backed & Expression-Bodied?
->Property (General)
  A property in C# is a member that provides controlled access to a class field using get and set accessors.
->Auto-Implemented Property
  An auto property is a property where the compiler automatically creates the backing field.
  It is used when no extra logic is needed in get/set.

->Backed Property
  A backed property (backing-field property) uses a private field to store the value and allows custom logic in get/set.

->Expression-Bodied Property
  An expression-bodied property is a short, concise syntax for properties that return a single expression.

1️⃣ Auto-Implemented Property
   Example
   class Student
   {
    public int Age { get; set; }
    }
2️⃣ Backed Property (Private Field)
    Example
    class Student
    {
    private int _age;
    public int Age
    {
        get { return _age; }
        set
        {
            if (value > 0)
                _age = value;
        }
     }
    }
3️⃣ Expression-Bodied Property
class Student
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }

    public string FullName => $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
}

7)Stack vs Heap Memory (C#)?
| Feature      |  Stack Memory| Heap Memory            |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Storage      | Value types  | Reference types        |
| Allocation   | Automatic    | Dynamic                |
| Deallocation | Automatic    | Garbage Collector      |
| Speed        | Fast         | Slower                 |
| Size         | Limited      | Large                  |
| Lifetime     | Method scope | Application controlled |
| Access       | Direct       | Reference-based        |


8)Boxing & Unboxing in C#?
->Boxing is the process of converting a value type into a reference type (object).
The value is wrapped inside an object and stored on the heap.

-Unboxing is the process of extracting the value type from the object back into its original value type.

9)Exception Handling in C# (try, catch, finally, throw)?
->Exception handling in C# is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors gracefully so that the program does not crash and continues execution in a controlled manner.
1️⃣ try Block-> The try block contains code that may cause an exception during program execution.
2️⃣ catch Block->The catch block handles the exception thrown in the try block and allows the program to continue execution.
3️⃣ finally Block->The finally block contains code that is always executed, whether an exception occurs or not.
4️⃣ throw Keyword->The throw keyword is used to explicitly generate an exception in a program.

10)Enum & Struct in C#?
->An enum is a value type that is used to define a set of named constant values, which makes the code more readable and meaningful.
Struct->A struct is a value type in C# used to group related variables of different data types into a single unit.

Enum (Enumeration)
enum Day
{
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday
}
how to use
Day today = Day.Monday;
Struct
struct Employee
{
    public int Id;
    public string Name;
}
how to use
Employee emp;
emp.Id = 1;
emp.Name = "Rahul";

One-Line Summary
Enum → Fixed named constants
Struct → Small grouped data


-----------------------------------------------Object-Oriented Programming(oop)------------------------------------------------
1)What Is The Oops and difference Between Functional & Object Oritend Programming Langauge?
->OOPs is a programming style where a program is built using objects that contain data and functions.
->Object-oriented programming is a programming style where programs are created using classes and objects.
OOPs 4 Pillars
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Functional programming is a programming style where programs are written using functions and data does not change.
| Feature             | Functional Programming | Object-Oriented Programming |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Focus               | Functions              | Objects                     |
| Data                | Immutable              | Mutable                     |
| State               | Avoids state           | Uses state                  |
| Code style          | Declarative            | Imperative                  |
| Reusability         | Function reuse         | Class & inheritance         |
| Real-world modeling | Difficult              | Easy                        |
| Examples            | F#, Haskell            | C#, Java                    |

2)What Is Class & Objects?
->class->A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (data/fields) and methods (behavior/functions) for objects.
  It does not occupy memory until an object is created.
  Think of it as a design or plan for an entity.

->object->An object is a real-world instance of a class.
  It contains actual data in memory.
  Objects have state (properties) and behavior (methods) as defined in their class.

3)What Is Constructor & Destructors?
->A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is created.
->It is used to initialize objects and set default values.
->Constructor name must be the same as the class name.
->No return type, not even void.
Types Of Constructor
Default Constructor->Called automatically when no constructor is defined.
Parameterized Constructor->Allows passing values during object creation.
Static Constructor->Used to initialize static members of the class. Called once automatically when the class is loaded.
                    Cannot take parameters.
Copy Constructor->A Copy Constructor is a constructor that creates a new object by copying the data of an existing object of the same class.
C# does not provide a built-in copy constructor, but you can create your own.'

this Keyword in C#->The this keyword in C# refers to the current instance of the class.

Destuctors
