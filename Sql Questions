1)What is Sql?
->SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to store, retrieve, update, and manage data in a relational database.
->MS SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)->MS SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.
  It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data using the SQL (Structured Query Language).
->MS SQL Server is software that allows users to:
  Create and manage databases
  Organize data in tables (rows and columns)
  Perform operations like Insert, Update, Delete, and Select
  Maintain data integrity, security, and performance
  It is widely used in web applications, desktop apps, data analytics, and enterprise systems.

2)SQL VS NO SQL Differences?
->SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables (rows and columns) using a fixed schema.
->NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible format such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or columns  without a fixed schema.
| Feature        | SQL                 | NoSQL             |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Data Model     | Relational (Tables) | Non-relational    |
| Schema         | Fixed schema        | Dynamic schema    |
| Scalability    | Vertical            | Horizontal        |
| Query Language | SQL                 | No standard query |
| Relationships  | Supports joins      | No joins          |
| Data Structure | Rows & columns      | JSON, key-value   |
| Consistency    | ACID                | BASE              |
| Examples       | MySQL, SQL Server   | MongoDB, Redis    |


3)What is Acid Properties In Sql?
->ACID properties are a set of rules that ensure reliable and safe database transactions.
->ACID = Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
A – Atomicity->transaction is all or nothing.
C – Consistency->Consistency ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
I – Isolation->Isolation ensures that multiple transactions do not affect each other.
D – Durability->Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved, even after system failure.

4)What is Importance of sql server in Modern?
->SQL Server is a powerful database system used to store, manage, secure, and analyze data for modern applications and businesses.
Why SQL Server is Important
-Data Storage & Management
-High Security
-High Performance
-Supports Modern Applications
-Transaction Support (ACID)
-Cloud & Hybrid Support


5)UnderStanding Dbms vs Rdbms
-A DBMS is software used to store, manage, and retrieve data from a database.
-An RDBMS is a type of DBMS that stores data in tables with rows and columns and maintains relationships between tables.

6)Relational DataBase Concepts?
->A Relational Database stores data in tables (relations) and connects those tables using keys.
->Core Relational Database Concepts
 -Table (Relation)
 -Row (Tuple)
 -Column (Attribute)
 -Primary Key
 -Foreign Key
 -Relationship-One-to-One
               One-to-Many
               Many-to-Many
 -Normalization
 -Constraints

------------------------------------------------------------------Sql Data Types & Contraints-------------------------------------------------------------
1)Built in Data-types(Numeric,Datetime,int,Text etc)
| Data Type      | Description                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `INT`          | Integer (whole number)            |
| `VARCHAR(n)`   | String with max length `n`        |
| `CHAR(n)`      | Fixed-length string               |
| `DATE`         | Date value                        |
| `DECIMAL(p,s)` | Decimal number (precision, scale) |
| `BIT`          | Boolean (0 or 1)                  |

2)User-Defined Datatypes?
->A User-Defined Data Type (UDDT) is a custom data type created by the user based on an existing SQL Server data type to reuse and standardize data.
CREATE TYPE PhoneNumber FROM varchar(10) NOT NULL;

3)Null Vs Not Null
->NULL
NULL means no value / unknown value stored in a column.
->Not Null
->NOT NULL means a column must have a value and cannot be empty.

4)What Is Constraints?
->Constraints are rules applied to table columns to control the type and validity of data stored in a database.
NULL
NULL means no value / unknown value stored in a column.
Not Null
NOT NULL means a column must have a value and cannot be empty.
UNIQUE Constraint
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different and no duplicate values are allowed.
PRIMARY KEY Constraint
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot contain NULL or duplicate values.
FOREIGN KEY Constraint
The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to link two tables together and ensures referential integrity between them.
CHECK Constraint
The CHECK constraint ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
DEFAULT Constraint
The DEFAULT constraint assigns a default value to a column when no value is provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------Sql Commands----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)What is Sql Commands?
->There Are The Five Types Of Commands
1)DDL,2)DML,3)DQL,4)DCL,5)TCL
| Type                                   | Purpose                   | Example                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **DDL (Data Definition Language)**     | Define database structure | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`         |
| **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**   | Manage data inside tables | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`      |
| **DCL (Data Control Language)**        | Control user access       | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                 |
| **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** | Manage transactions       | `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT` |
| **DQL (Data Query Language)**          | Retrieve data             | `SELECT`                          |

------------------------------------------------------------------------Clauses----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Where Clause?
->The WHERE clause is used to filter records and return only the rows that match a specific condition.
Operators Used with WHERE
| Operator | Use                 |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| =        | Equal               |
| >        | Greater             |
| <        | Less                |
| >=       | Greater or equal    |
| <=       | Less or equal       |
| <> / !=  | Not equal           |
| AND      | All conditions true |
| OR       | Any condition true  |
| IN       | Multiple values     |
| BETWEEN  | Range               |
| LIKE     | Pattern search      |
| IS NULL  | Check null          |


2)Order By Clause?
->The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.

3)Group BY With Having?
->The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values and apply aggregate functions on each group.
->HAVING->The HAVING clause is used to filter groups after grouping is done.
  GROUP BY → Group data
  HAVING → Filter grouped data

4)Top Keyword?
->The TOP keyword is used to limit the number of rows returned in the result set.

5)Logical Operators(And,or,Not)
->The AND operator in SQL is used to combine two or more conditions in a WHERE clause.
It returns TRUE only if all the conditions separated by AND are true.
If any one of the conditions is false, the result will be false.

SQL OR OPERATOR
The OR operator in SQL is used to combine two or more conditions in a WHERE clause.
It returns TRUE if any one of the conditions separated by OR is true.
If all conditions are false, then the result will be false.

SQL NOT OPERATOR
The NOT operator in SQL is used to negate a condition.
It returns TRUE if the condition is FALSE, and FALSE if the condition is TRUE.
Essentially, it reverses the result of a condition.


SQL IN Operator
The IN operator in SQL is used to check if a value matches any value in a list or subquery.
It is a shorthand for multiple OR condition

SQL NOT IN Operator
The NOT IN operator in SQL is used to exclude values that match any value in a list or subquery.
It returns TRUE if the value does not match any value in the list.

SQL BETWEEN Operator
The BETWEEN operator in SQL is used to filter the result set within a specific range.
It selects values between two specified values, inclusive of the boundary values.

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

SQL NOT BETWEEN Operator
The NOT BETWEEN operator in SQL is used to exclude values within a specific range.
It returns TRUE for values outside the range.

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name NOT BETWEEN value1 AND value2;


SQL LIKE OPERATOR
The LIKE operator in SQL is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
It is often used with wildcards to perform partial matches rather than exact matches.

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';


IsNull->ISNULL() is a SQL Server function used to replace NULL values with a specified value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------Sql Set Operators-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL Set Operators are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.
1️⃣ UNION
Definition:
Combines results of multiple SELECT queries and removes duplicate rows.

2️⃣ UNION ALL
Definition:
Combines results of two SELECT queries and keeps duplicate rows.

3️⃣ INTERSECT
Definition:
Returns only common rows from both SELECT queries.

4️⃣ EXCEPT
Definition:
Returns rows that exist in the first SELECT but not in the second.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------Sql Joins--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sql Joins-SQL JOINs are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
1️⃣ INNER JOIN
Returns only the records that match in both tables.
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

2️⃣ LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.

SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

3️⃣ RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.

SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

4️⃣ FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from both tables, matching or not.
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

5️⃣ CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product (every row of one table with every row of another).
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2

6️⃣ SELF JOIN
A table is joined with itself is Called Self Join.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sql Indexing----------------------------------------------------------------
1)What is Indexing In Sql?
->Indexing in SQL is a technique used to speed up data retrieval from a database table by creating a quick lookup structure.
Create Index Indexname on table(name);
Types of Indexes
1️⃣ Clustered Index->Data physically sorted
2️⃣ Non-Clustered Index->Separate structure

2)Clustred vs Non Clustred Index
| Feature          | Clustered Index          | Non-Clustered Index  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Data Storage     | Physically sorted        | Separate structure   |
| Number per table | Only ** 1 **             | **Multiple**         |
| Speed            | Faster for range queries | Faster for search    |
| Pointer          | Data itself              | Pointer to data      |
| Primary Key      | By default clustered     | Non-clustered        |
| Space            | Less extra space         | Requires extra space |
--for example
-- Clustered Index
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_emp_id
ON Employees(Id);

-- Non-Clustered Index
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_emp_name
ON Employees(Name);

3)What Is a Composite Index? (SQL Server).
->A composite index is an index created on two or more columns of a table to improve query performance when those columns are used together in a query.
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept_salary
ON Employees(DepartmentId, Salary);

4)What is Covering Index?
->A covering index is an index that contains all the columns needed by a query, so SQL Server can return results directly from the index without accessing the table.

 5)Filtered Index & Indexed Views (SQL Server)
->A filtered index is a non-clustered index created with a WHERE condition, so it stores only a subset of rows.
->An indexed view is a view that has a unique clustered index.

 6)How To show All Indexes?
 ->  EXEC sp_helpindex 'Table Name';

------------------------------------SQL Server Functions-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Aggregate Functions(Sum,Avg,Count,Max,Min)->
The MAX() function in SQL is used to return the largest value from a specified column.
The MIN() function in SQL is used to return the smallest value from a specified column.
The SUM() function in SQL is used to calculate the total (sum) of all values in a specified numeric column.
The AVG() function in SQL is used to calculate the average (mean) value of a numeric column.
The COUNT() function in SQL is used to count the number of rows that match a specified condition.

2)Sql Scalar Functions(LEN,GETDATE,ISNULL,CONVERT)
->Scalar functions are SQL functions that return a single value for each input row.

--------------------------------------------SQL Views-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)What is System Views?
->System Views are built-in SQL Server views that store metadata information about databases, tables, columns, indexes, users, and server objects.

2)User-Defined Views (SQL Server)?
->A User-Defined View is a virtual table created by the user using a SELECT query to simplify data access and improve security.
CREATE VIEW vw_EmployeeDetails
AS
SELECT Id, Name, Salary
FROM Employees;

----------------------------------------------Sql Triggers------------------------------------------------------------
A SQL Trigger is a special stored procedure that automatically executes when an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation occurs on a table or view.
🔑 Types of Triggers
1️⃣ DML Triggers
Data change par fire hote hain
AFTER Trigger
INSTEAD OF Trigger
2️⃣ DDL Triggers
Schema changes par fire hote hain
3️⃣ LOGON Triggers
User login par fire hote hain
BEFORE Trigger: Executes before a data modification happens.
AFTER Trigger: Executes after the data modification is completed.

INSTEAD OF->Change The Reason

-------------------------------------------------Store Prcoedure--------------------------------------------
A Stored Procedure in SQL is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements stored in the database.
It can accept input parameters, perform operations, and return results.
Stored procedures help reuse code, improve performance, and maintain security.

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    @parameter1 datatype,
    @parameter2 datatype OUTPUT -- optional
AS
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;

Execution:

EXEC GetEmployeesByDepartment 'IT';
