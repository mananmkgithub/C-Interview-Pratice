1)What is Sql?
->SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to store, retrieve, update, and manage data in a relational database.
->MS SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)->MS SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.
  It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data using the SQL (Structured Query Language).
->MS SQL Server is software that allows users to:
  Create and manage databases
  Organize data in tables (rows and columns)
  Perform operations like Insert, Update, Delete, and Select
  Maintain data integrity, security, and performance
  It is widely used in web applications, desktop apps, data analytics, and enterprise systems.

2)SQL VS NO SQL Differences?
->SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables (rows and columns) using a fixed schema.
->NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible format such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or columns  without a fixed schema.
| Feature        | SQL                 | NoSQL             |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Data Model     | Relational (Tables) | Non-relational    |
| Schema         | Fixed schema        | Dynamic schema    |
| Scalability    | Vertical            | Horizontal        |
| Query Language | SQL                 | No standard query |
| Relationships  | Supports joins      | No joins          |
| Data Structure | Rows & columns      | JSON, key-value   |
| Consistency    | ACID                | BASE              |
| Examples       | MySQL, SQL Server   | MongoDB, Redis    |


3)What is Acid Properties In Sql?
->ACID properties are a set of rules that ensure reliable and safe database transactions.
->ACID = Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
A – Atomicity->transaction is all or nothing.
C – Consistency->Consistency ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
I – Isolation->Isolation ensures that multiple transactions do not affect each other.
D – Durability->Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved, even after system failure.

4)What is Importance of sql server in Modern?
->SQL Server is a powerful database system used to store, manage, secure, and analyze data for modern applications and businesses.
Why SQL Server is Important
-Data Storage & Management
-High Security
-High Performance
-Supports Modern Applications
-Transaction Support (ACID)
-Cloud & Hybrid Support
